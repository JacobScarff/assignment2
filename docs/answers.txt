8. 	1 Inheritance is when a new class has properties and behaviors from an existing class.
	2 Polymorphism allows objects from different classes to be treated as objects of the same superclass.
	3 Encapsulation is bundling of data and the meathods that operate on the data into a single class.
9. The Dictator and Lieutenants workflow operates on a sense of a hierarchy, since the lieutenants merge some of the developers work and then give it to the dictator to finish. While a Centralized workflow has one single manager getting everything from the developers and doing it themselves.
10. This would basically help split up the work load better since there can be multiple lieutenants that oversea a decent amount of developers ensuring that the work is done in a more efficient way and not putting to big of a work load on one person.
